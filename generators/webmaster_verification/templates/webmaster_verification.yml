# WebmasterVerification Configuration
#
# Add your webmaster verification keys to this file
# Currently, only Google, Yahoo! and Live are supported
#
# For Google, add the filename
# For Yahoo!, add the filename and the content to go in the file
# For Live, add the user's id
#
# You can add several different users to each service,
# or no users at all, and the names don't have to be the
# same from one browser to the next - they are just there
# to make it easy to identify who owns what
#
# Example:
#
#   google:
#     user: google151515.html
#   yahoo:
#     user:
#       filename: y_key_151515.html
#       content: 151515
#   live:
#     user: 151515
